## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

### Mock API Implementations (8 APIs)

These APIs work but return mock/placeholder data. They are:

- ✅ **Functional**: Return valid responses
- ✅ **Documented**: Clearly marked as mock
- ✅ **Non-Blocking**: Don't prevent launch
- ✅ **Upgradeable**: Can be replaced with real APIs later

**Mock APIs**:

1. `/api/banking/rbi-rates` - Mock RBI rates
2. `/api/startup-india/schemes` - Mock Startup India data
3. `/api/companies/mca-verify` - Mock MCA verification
4. `/api/msme/schemes` - Mock MSME schemes
5. `/api/images/unsplash` - Mock Unsplash images
6. `/api/github/user` - Mock GitHub user data
7. `/api/currency/exchange-rate` - Mock exchange rates
8. `/api/branding/generate` - Placeholder AI generation

**Impact**: These are **optional features** that enhance the platform but don't block core functionality.
